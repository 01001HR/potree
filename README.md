## About

Potree is a free open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds.

It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/)


<a href="http://potree.org/wp/demo/" target="_blank"> ![](./docs/images/potree_screens.png) </a>

Potree was part of the [Harvest4D Project](https://harvest4d.org/)

Newest information and work in progress is usually available on [twitter](https://twitter.com/m_schuetz)

General infos, downloads, showcase, etc. at [potree.org](http://potree.org/)

## Downloads

[PotreeConverter source and Win64 binaries](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/releases)

## Build

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download this repository.
* Open a console window
* Change into the potree directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd <potree_directory>
npm install --save-dev
```

* Create the build, including a minified version:

```
npm run build
npm run min:script:*
```

Watch commands are helpful during development since they automatically rebuild the project whenever you modify a source file. The ```+webserver``` variant also starts a webserver, which is needed to test potree pages on your local machine.
The ```+liveserver``` version is the same as the webserver version, except it also automatically refreshes your browser when you modify the source.

It's recommended to use ```npm run watch+liveserver```. 
On startup, it will open a browser page at ```http://localhost:8080/```. Open the examples folder to select various demo pages.

```
npm run watch
npm run watch+webserver
npm run watch+liveserver
```



## Showcase

Take a look at the [potree showcase](http://potree.org/wp/demo/) for some live examples.
